# Test project for Softarex Technologies.


A test project for Softarex is being developed in this repository. 

At the moment 
I am studying the technologies with which the project should be made (now **React**).
The basic functionality that is found in most React projects (*adding, deleting, 
sorting, searching, hooks and custom hooks, pagination, React router, component lifecycle, 
working with the server (Axios) and other React features*) studying right now

The dev environment, the bundler (**[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)**) are also set up and the application 
structure is made. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

On your personal computer you must have latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

NPM Setup:
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### App running

I use Vite to build the project [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

You need to follow this simple steps for running this app:

1. Clone the repo
 
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run Vite scripts for run the app

``` 
npm run dev
```

4. Open your defaulting browser and open tab with next address (if it's not open automatically)

```

```
